REDESIGN
- Have the title like it is now
- Header should come out of the top of the title after a few seconds, make the font much more VCR mono vibe
- On click, it should scroll down, and there should be a menu bar with the nanos garage logo in the middle, and then the tabs either on the right or left.
- The bottom should have the content centered in the middle
- Keep it simple, easy fade in and out animations.
